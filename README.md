12/10/2022: Angular(softwares,versions)

1.Install vscode & node.js
2.node-v (node.js version)
3.npm-v (Node Package Manager(npm)version)

4.open vscode | Create a folder and name it | Copy the path of folder | open vscode-cmd-paste the path | angular installed

5.Installation of angular project: open vs code in admin mode | Terminal-new terminal in cmd | a.npm install-g@angular/cli | b.ng new my-app (project name of angular) | c.cd my app (cd-change directory) | d.ng serve (to open the project)

URL-Uniform Resource Locator -Specifices where a unique resource can be found on the internet.

 http://localhost:4200
  |        |       |
 client  local    Port
 server  Address
Q.What is port and what happens multiple projects run at a time with same port ?

It identifies a service provided by an application.
Same port number is not used for different applications.Error will be detected.
Routing: changes the path/selecting a path across one or more networks.

Typescript:

Superset of javascript Helps programmers to write object oriented programs and have compiled to js both server and client side. easy to use,build application faster,good tooling support.

Q.Diff b/w typescript and javascript?

typescript: datatype is fixed,detect the error immediately.code maintaince,easier to learn,static typing
javascript: datatype is not fixed.it will run the code and later it detects the error,has dynamic typing.

2 imp process that angular adopts to reduce the size of application minification: removes white spaces,unwanted variable within file, conatins big variable names to smaller variable names. ============================================================================== 18/10/2022:

why ts?

because it has types.js has no types.

Datatypes--Every value or data has an associated type nothing but datatype.
           Determines how the value or data can be used in programm.

a.String--Enclosed with ""  eg;"123"
b.integer--Any number       eg;1,2,0,-1,-2
c.Float--decimal number     eg:1.0, 20.3
d.Boolean--True or False
e.enums
f.objects,
g.void--use to represent non returning functions.

19/10/2022:

for loop--

for(initial value;termination_condition;steps/incrementals/step by which value should incrementation.

while--

initial condition-steps/incrementals/step by which value should incrementation.

eg.,if(i<=100) then while is stoped.

do while-- first do{} then while(condition) is executed.

Javascript and typescript programmes are executed in synchronous way.i.e.,step by step.
